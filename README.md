INST414-Data-Science-Project
==============================

Sprint 2: Progress
- Completed EDA of cleaned version of the Global Health Statistics dataset.
- Found no patterns/correlations that can support my problem.
- Created some alternate ideas I could do.
- Need to discuss with professor/instructional team about where to go from here.
